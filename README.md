# Youtube Player Restoration Project

On August of 2015 Google updated their Youtube player. While the performance and bug fixes where welcomed, many users disliked the new interface and missed old features. This project attempts to restore the look and interface of the Youtube player to its state before the update by Google.

For those coming here for the install the stable version, its hosted at:

https://userstyles.org/styles/117273/youtube-player-august-2015

For those interested in testing the Dev userscript version, please report any bugs as you come across them. The script can be found here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snintendog/Youtube-Player-Editing-2015/master/Dev/YPARWL.user.js

or by downloading the repository. To use it you'll need [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) for Chrome. Tampermonkey should work for Opera as well.

Support is unknown for IE and Safari (and if you're still using IE, please get a better browser, it'll make the world a better place). The script has been tested on Firefox mainly, so if you find issues on Chrome or Opera, report any strange behaviors.



##TODO

Decided to go further than originally planned:

  * UI

    - Grid Subsciptions
    - Watch Page
    - Auto play next video removal and disable default
    - Hide comments section and load with a button
    - Auto expand description
    - Color customization
    - Add settings page to contain all changes and save them

  * Player

    - Fix embeds
    - Allow for full screen to have auto hide and scaled controls
      - new transparent controls have the mouse over fix not affect full screen while keeping it for embeds and watch page
    - Settings for all of player items to be toggled

  * Other

    - Logo and Better Name
